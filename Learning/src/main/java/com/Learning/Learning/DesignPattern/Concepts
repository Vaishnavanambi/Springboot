Design Pattern:
==============
    * A design pattern is a proven, reusable solution to a common problem that occurs in software design.
    * Instead of reinventing the wheel every time you face a particular kind of design issue, you can apply a pattern that captures best practices and proven strategies used by experienced developers.

Adv:
====
    * Helps make code more flexible, reusable, and maintainable.


Categories of Design Patterns:
==============================
    * Creational
    * Structural
    * Behavioural

Creational Design Pattern:
=========================
    * used to create or controls the creation of object.

    1. Prototype
    2. Singleton
    3. Factory
    4. Builder


Prototype:
=========
    * used when we need to clone the object.
    Ex:Lets say we have the some object with more than 100 fields in it, now we need to clone of the object.
    Instead of creating new object and setting all fields of old object ot new object.
    we can use clone() to create the clone, using this we can reduce the coding complexity

Singleton:
==========
    * used when we need only one instance of object.
    Ex:Lets say when we DBconnection, since only one DB connection is enough we can go for singleton.
    What if we made DB connection everytime when we update or store or fetch data?
    Since DB connection is costlier operation it may result is performance issue.

Factory:
========
    * used to (abstracts Object creation)create object without exposing instantiation logic and factory will decide which subclass object to create.
    Ex: Let say we have Circle and Triangle class which is subclass of shape interface, now if we want to create Circle or triangle object
    we explicitly mention Shape sh = new Circle() or new Triangle(), to abstract the creation logic we use Factory Pattern.

Builder:
========
    * used to create complex object step by step.
    Ex: We have a class which has 100+ fields, we have to set fields by setter or use constructor to initialize it,
    but for 100+ fields, if we try to set fields it will take 100+ lines or if we use constructor we don't know which field we are setting.
    Some fields may be null also passing null in constructor will not look good also.


Structural Design Pattern:
=========================
    * It is a way to combine or arrange different objects and classes to form complex or bigger structure.

    1. Decorator


Decorator Design Pattern:
=========================
    * used to add more functionalities to existing object without modifying its structure.
    Ex: Lets say we have Burger class with two children veg and chicken burger, now we want to add cheese to burger then,
    do we need to create another class with cheeseVeg or chicken and in future we are adding mayo then do we need to create
    cheeseVeg, cheeseMayoVeg, MayoVeg and CheeseChicken...
    To solve this problem we can use decorator pattern.

Proxy Design Pattern:
=====================
    * used as intermediate to control the access of original object(logging,security etc..)
    Ex: Lets say whenever user try to run command, we need to check if he is a valid user to run the certain command,
    if he is not a valid user then there is not need to create the original object as it may be costlier operation.
    Ex: Whenever user tries to access certain service, we need to log the operations, but we don't want our original object to be changed
    To Solve these type of things we can use Proxy Pattern
